# tap_case

Recently I bought a set of metric taps from some vendor in China. I would not recommend the use of these taps for any serious metal work unless your don't mind
spending your time removing broken taps but before I bought them I figured that they might be able to at least tap plastic, specifically the threads I
occasionally need in the parts I 3D print.

They came in a plastic bag and I figured I might use a case for them and the handle they came with so I made one using FreeCAD. For those of you that want a
similar one this directory contains STL mesh file you will need to print your own. For the undaunted ones, I also added the FreeCAD master file.
